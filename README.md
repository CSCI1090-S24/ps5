# Problem Set 5
You should feel comfortable with GitHub by now. If you're not, come to office hours with me or the TAs.

If you think you see an error or typo, let me know! I will update [this version of the repo](https://github.com/CSCI1090-S24/ps4) with any corrections you suggest.

The deliverables for this problem set are the following:

* `lemonade.py`

**Remember** I now expect you to write comments in your code! One point will be deducted if you do not provide comments explaining your code. Here's what I would like commented this time:

* Before every function, describe what it does and what its arguments are. Exception: you do not need to explain what `main()` is for.
* Before every variable, explain what value it is holding. Exception: variables that appear after the keyword `for`.

**Remember** Now at the top of very files, you will include your honor pledge. The first four lines (comments) of every Python file should be this information. You will lose one point if you don't include these four lines.

* The name of the file.
* Your name.
* The date.
* "This code is my own work. I did not share my code or look at the code of another student. I did not consult ChatGPT, CoPilot, or another large language model."

**Note** You may not import any libraries to complete this assignment. IYKYK.
