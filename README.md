# Problem Set 5
You should feel comfortable with GitHub by now. If you're not, come to office hours with me or the TAs.

If you think you see an error or typo, let me know! I will update [this version of the repo](https://github.com/CSCI1090-S24/ps4) with any corrections you suggest.

The deliverables for this problem set are the following:

* `lemonade.py`

**Remember** I now expect you to write comments in your code! One point will be deducted if you do not provide comments explaining your code. Here's what I would like commented this time:

* Before every function, describe what it does and what its arguments are. Exception: you do not need to explain what `main()` is for.
* Before every variable, explain what value it is holding. Exception: variables that appear after the keyword `for`.

**Remember** Now at the top of every file, you will include your honor pledge. The first four lines (comments) of every Python file should be this information. You will lose one point if you don't include these four lines.

* The name of the file.
* Your name.
* The date.
* "This code is my own work. I did not share my code or look at the code of another student. I did not consult ChatGPT, CoPilot, or another large language model."

**Note** The only libraries you can import are `random()` and `math()`. 

## Lemonade Stand Game
You will write a game in which the user runs a lemonade stand. The user starts with $10. Their goal is to sell enough lemonade in 10 days to double their money to $20. 

A glass of lemonade costs 50 cents to make, and each glass sells for $1. Every day the user is told the chance of rain that day, and they must decide how many glasses of lemonade to make using their available money. If it rains, none of their lemonade will be sold. If it is sunny, all of their lemonade will be sold.

You will let the user play the game, keeping track each day of the number of glasses they make, the number of glasses they sell, the chance of rain that day, and whether or not it was sunny.

I've given you some starter code. You will have two chunks of code to write.

**Chunk 1:** `while()` loop to run the game
While the number of days so far is less than 10:
  * Tell the user the current day.
  * The the user how much money they have right now.
  * Generate a random number between 0 and 1 to serve as the `chance of rain`.
  * Ask the user how many glasses of lemonade they want to make. If they say more glasses than they have money to make, let them know and then ask them again for the numerb of glasses they want to make.
  * Get another random number between 0 and 1.
      - If it's less than the `chance of rain`, it rained. No lemonade was sold, so deduct 50 cents for each glass made from the user's total money.
      - If it's more than the `chance of rain`, it was sunny. All the lemonade was sold, so add 50 cents for each glass ($1 sale price minus 50 cents cost to make the lemonade) to the user's total money.
  * Enter the stats into the list of lists called `stats`: the number of glasses they made, the number of glasses they sold, the chance of rain that day, and whether or not it was sunny.

**Chunk 2:** Calculate and report statistics of the game
* Using a for loop over the `stats` list of lists, calculate
  - (1) the total number of glasses of lemonade made;
  - (2) the total number of glasses of lemonade sold;
  - (3) the average number of glasses sold per day;
  - (4) the number of sunny days; and
  - (5) the average chance of rain over the 10 days. 
* Print out these statistics to the user, using the wording shows in the example below.

Your output will look something like this, though the numbers will be different.
